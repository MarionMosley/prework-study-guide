# Prework Study Guide

## Description

I created this website as prework for a bootcamp with the intention of showcasing the skills I learnt and practice them further, like using HTML, CSS and Javascript and alot of the principles of coding, like Agile and Gitflow. In creating this I hope new students at the bootcamp can use this as a helpful guide to gain some info on the prework.
